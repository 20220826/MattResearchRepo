Github/Repository Creation

### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
Via Wikipedia: A minimum viable product has just enough core features to effectively deploy the product, and no more. Developers typically deploy the product to a subset of possible customers, such as early adopters who are thought to be more forgiving, more likely to give feedback, and able to grasp a product vision from an early prototype or marketing information. This strategy targets avoiding building products that customers do not want and seek to maximize information about the customer with the least money spent. The technique falls under the Lean Startup methodology as MVPs aim to test business hypotheses and validated learning is one of the five principles of the Lean Startup method.[12] It contrasts strongly with the traditional "stealth mode" method of product development where businesses make detailed business plans spanning a considerable time horizon. Steve Blank posited that the main principle of the Lean Startup approach rests in the validation of the hypotheses underlying the product by asking customers if they want the product or if the product meets their needs, and pivoting to another approach if the hypothesis turns out to be false.[11] This approach to validating business ideas cheaply before substantial investment saves costs and limits risk as businesses that upon experimentation turn out to be commercially unfeasible can easily be terminated. It is especially important as the main cause of startup failure is the lack of market need;[13] that is, many startups fail because their product isn't needed by many people, and so they cannot generate enough revenue to recoup the initial investment. Thus it can be said that utilizing an MVP would illuminate a prospective entrepreneur on the market demand for their products.

## Week 3

### What is Python?

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

## Week 4
### What is Art? What is Programming?

Video-graph instructions

Gather a group of people, each with a mobile phone. 

Each person must start recording a video at the same time.

Each person should frame one other person in their video. 

The recording ends when one of the people leave one of the frames. 

Watch the videos together.

Each person should place their phone on the floor or table and press play, and then step back

Option to record the videos playing together

Reflective questions: How did you feel as a subject of a video? Did you notice your ego? How are we evolving with this device? How could we draw this activity? Did you feel more attachment to the phone than to your image?

Confused about what a graph is? Check out this linked in course on graph and data science fundamentals graph in business today

What is meant by the term acyclic in the context of graphs? The're often called Dags for short. 

What is the type of art that we did today? It has many names, sometimes people call it Relational Aesthetics and could be descried as art work which has the tendency to blur the distinction between audience and performer. What type of art did you do today? (Video-graph)

What type of tools can I try to generating images from text like you did? python text to image (pytti) is one of the strong examples. VQGAN and Clip, disco diffusion are others. I would avoid going for the simplest and better known (midjourney and DallE) at this point because they have followed the pattern of trying to own the copywrite for your work. You can use Google Colab for free to run notebooks which have these models available.

What is a bias mitigation technique that you mentioned? Please see the attached article A Survey on Bias and Fairness in Machine Learning. 

Still feeling lost? Kei te pai. We are all in this together. We have 2 full weeks before any assignments are due. The first is Your Research Repository, which is due on Friday 2nd September. This is all about how you reflect on the work that your doing including these types of sessions which might ask you to be quite open.

So make sure that you reflect on your feelings such a as "I feel lost after this class." write it up. What did you expect to be different? What would help to orient you? Can you see some benefit in the openness of this class format? What do you plan to do for your project. It's ok for it to change, you don't need to be consistent from week to week. Perhaps after a few weeks, you will feel differently about today's session. This type of experience is good.

## Week 5 
agile rituals
Marshmallow challenge
### What did you learn out of the Marshmallow Challenge? 

### What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?

## Week 6

## Misc.

### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?

### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
The purpose of timeboxing is to ensure that you use your time productively. To use this technique, you assign a specific deadline to each task. This is known as a timebox and when it's finished, you analyze your progress and move on to the next one.

### On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?

### What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?

### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. 

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?

### Have you developed a habit of exploring?

### Have you meditated before?

### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?

### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?

### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

### Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?

### What is an IDE?
Programmers often make use of an IDE software which stands for Integrated Development Environment. An IDE contains various tools such as a source code editor, a compiler and/or interpreter and a debugger that help a computer programmer write computer programs. The source code editor is where you write your instructions. The compiler/interpreter then takes these instructions and converts them to a language that the computer can understand – binary language. The first programmers used to have to enter the binary codes themselves. This was known as machine code programming and is incredibly difficult to understand. The compiler/interpreter makes life a lot easier by taking the instructions written in C# or Python for example and converting them to binary so that the computer can understand what you want it to do. Take the example of an English person talking to a French person. If they both only knew their own languages, they would need someone else to interpret/translate any communication that takes place between them. The compiler/interpreter is just like that.

### Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?

### So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?

### What is OOP?
The technique that evolved is called Object-Oriented Programming, or OOP. Instead of being a list of instructions, programs now acted as models of the problems they were solving.

Taking this Object-Oriented approach, computer programs became much more adaptable to their environment. Instead of situations where a single large executable block of code is used, objects that communicate with each other by sending messages back and forth were used. One of the many advantages to this way of programming was that programs became easier to understand, because they could be thought of as written in more natural language.

As you work through this course, you will be introduced to the Python language, which although object-oriented is ideal for writing procedural code

### Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

### What is polymorphism?

In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband and an employee.

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

### What is pair programming?

Pair programming is an Agile software development technique originating from Extreme programming (XP) in which two developers team together on one computer. The two people work together to design, code and test user stories.

### What are you looking forward to learning about programming?

### What is conscious listening?

What is conscious listening? Conscious listening is the act of being intentionally present during communication between yourself and another while being aware of your own and the other's feelings and needs.

### What is a variable?

When working with applications, you store information in variables. A variable is a kind of storage box. Whenever you want to work with the information, you access it using the variable. If you have new information you want to store, you put it in a variable. Changing information means accessing the variable first and then storing the new value in the variable. Just as you store things in boxes in the real world, so you store things in variables (a kind of storage box) when working with applications. Each variable stores just one piece of information.

Using this technique makes it easy to find the particular piece of information you need — unlike in your closet, where things could be hidden. Most applications rely heavily on variables to make working with information easier.

Take real life for example. People tend to store things in the wrong sort of box. For example, you might find a pair of shoes in a garment bag and a supply of pens in a shoe box. However, programming languages like to be neat. As a result, you find numbers stored in one sort of variable and text stored in an entirely different kind of variable. Yes, you use variables in both cases, but the variable is designed to store a particular kind of information.

Using specialised variables makes it possible to work with the information inside in particular ways. You don’t need to worry about the details just yet — just keep in mind that each kind of information is stored in a special kind of variable, making it easier for the programmer to follow and ensuring the information remains safe. However, computers don’t actually know about information types. All that the computer knows about are 0s and 1s. At a higher level, computers do work with numbers, but that’s the extent of what computers do. Numbers, letters, dates, times, and any other kind of information you can think about all come down to 0s and 1s in the computer system. 

### What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?

### What is something kind that someone has done for you?

### If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?

### Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?

### What is a fixed mindset?

In a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them. They also believe that talent alone creates success—without effort.”

### What is something kind you have done for someone else?

### Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?

### Have you developed a habit of persevering?
