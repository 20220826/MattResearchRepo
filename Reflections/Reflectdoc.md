# Reflections

## Week1

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a coding language with a simple visual interface that allows people to create digital stories, games, and animations. Example files found [here](../Code)

Scratch is very similar to another visiual code we used my last course [https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html) I have incuded some of that code [here](../Code/Blasteroid Assessment.xml)

### What is a variable?
In programming information is stored in variables. The information is accessed by using the variable. Changing information means accessing the variable first and then storing the new value in the variable. Just as you store things in boxes in the real world, so you store things in variables (a kind of storage box) when working with applications. Each variable stores just one piece of information.

## Week 2 Github/Repository Creation

### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
Minimum Viable Product. An MVP is a version of a product with minimum core features to effectively deploy the product. Developers usually deploy the product to early customers who can provide feedback for future development. This ideally reduces the amount of unnecessary work. 
Description for 6 year olds: An MVP is a practice thing that you can try and find out if you like it and what you would change. You can tell me the things you like & don't like and if it's something you would be keen to try again. This way, I don't spend lots of time and money making something you don't like. We can sort of work together to take my idea and make it something you will enjoy. 

## Week 3

### What is Python?
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented l programming language. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

### Javascript vs Python
Doing Python today the most difficult thing for me was switching mindset to a different syntax and programming code. In my last cousre we did Javascript. I found myself constantly trying to write Javascript, It took a very consicous effort in the end to use python commands and syntax. [Python Code](../Code)

### What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming. Instead of being a list of instructions, OOP programs act as models of the problems they solve.

Taking this Object-Oriented approach, computer programs became much more adaptable to their environment. Instead of situations where a single large executable block of code is used, objects that communicate with each other by sending messages back and forth were used. One of the many advantages to this way of programming was that programs became easier to understand, because they could be thought of as written in more natural language. In this course we use Python, which is object-oriented as well as ideal for writing procedural code.

### What is an IDE?
Integrated Development Environment. An IDE contains tools such as a source code editor, a compiler and/or interpreter and a debugger that help a programmer write computer programs. 
The source code editor is where you write your instructions. The compiler/interpreter then takes these instructions and converts them to binary language. The compiler/interpreter takes instructions written in C# or Python for example and converts them to binary.

## Week 4: What is Art? What is Programming?

### What is a graph?
A knowledge graph is a representation of a knowledge domain (ie Google, You Tube, Tic Toc, Facebook, Instagram), which can be read by humans and machines. The human user receives the results of the knowledge graph as a textual or visual representation, eg in diagram form. Knowledge graphs can be used for data analytics. Graphs acquire the data of different sources and links them together in order to analyze research publications' statistical data and patents. This allows automated evaluation and use of knowledge for machine learning or for the automated classification of content.

### What is meant by the term acyclic in the context of graphs? 
Acyclic means that objects in a graph (represented by vertices) do not create a cycle or loop. An example of this in computing is scheduling. One object or task leads to another, which leads to another. There's a possibility that one object may be missed but not that one would lead back to a previous object creating a "loop". A "real life" example is family trees. One person begot another person who begot another person. That 3rd person cannot beget the first or second. 

### What is the type of art that we did today? 
Relational Aesthetics, art work which has the tendency to blur the distinction between audience and performer. 

Video-graph instructions

-Gather a group of people, each with a mobile phone. 
-Each person must start recording a video at the same time.
-Each person should frame one other person in their video. 
-The recording ends when one of the people leave one of the frames. 
-Watch the videos together. Each person should place their phone on the floor or table and press play, and then step back

### How did you feel as a subject of a video? Did you notice your ego?
Extremely uncomfortable especially being filmed by someone I don't know. Yes I noticed my ego in the sense that I was self concious and aware that I was self concious.

### How are we evolving with this device? 

### How could we draw this activity? 
We could draw it like an acyclical graph. One vertex would be starting the recording. The next would be framing a person in their video. Next - stoping recording when someone leaves the frame. Next would be watching the videos. There's no ability to loop one of these instructions back to another. 

### Did you feel more attachment to the phone than to your image?
More attachment to my image. 

### What do you plan to do for your project?
Some ideas I've had include:
A website that searches for trees based on different filters, eg evergree/deciduous, fully grown height, ideal growing conditions, etc. I'd like to call the website "treesearch.com" to play on "research". 
A website that acts as a central source where election candidates (local body government, school board, etc) can post profiles of themselves, that is a level playing field for each canditate to be able to share what they are about, removing the barrier of "who can put up the most signs?", but everyone has the same space and opportunity to share and compare their message and values. 
An app for binary to decimal translations and vice versa.  

## Week 5 Agile rituals

### What did you learn out of the Marshmallow Challenge? 
I don't think I learned anything concrete from this challenge. I assume it had something to do with the Agile method of Software Development, but given fellow students lack of following the challenge all the way as instructed, and no follow up or debrief from anyone in any capacity, The Marshmallow Challenge did not succeed in its intended purpose. 

### What is pair programming?
Pair programming is an Agile software development technique where two developers team up together on one computer to design, code and test user stories.

### What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?
Getting the Python [Koans](../Code/Koans) to function in Visual Studio Code.

## Week 6

### What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism is the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. An example of polymorphism child who simultaneously is a daughter, a sister, a student and more.

### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
I have not established a habit of regular breaks from the screen while I am studying. When I do step away from the screen, I move and stretch my body a bit. 

### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
The purpose of timeboxing is to ensure that you use your time productively. To use this technique, you assign a specific deadline to each task. This is known as a timebox and when it's finished, you analyze your progress and move on to the next one. I used this technique in my last course of study, although I wasn't aware of the term, it's just what made sense to me. 

### On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?
2

### What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?
Doing some Python coding and succeeding in completing the following challenges with little prior experience with Python before. 

### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. 

I'm a visual/kinestetic learner. I need to see examples of what I need to do, and/or just get stuck in to figure things out. Trial & error is a prominent strategy for me. While these typically work out, it can be very time consuming. Timeboxing has been helpful in my studies with this. I need to have set expectations for the time I will work towards a designated task without feeling the need to move on to other projects, so that I have time to go through the trial & error process without becoming overwhelmed by workload. 

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
Read "GitHub for Dummies" NOW.

### Have you developed a habit of exploring?
No. I have a hard time exploring without an clear end point or goal. 

### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?
Video game. Swimming. Practice, persistence, commitment.

### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?
No. If anything at this point I think software developement is not for me. 

### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
Yes I value creativity as a value itself. One of the biggest things I have struggled to reconcile in this course is using creativity without having the ability to to execute it or having it in the context of coding/software development. 

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
10 open tabs, 9 study related 1 not.

### So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?
Doing and understanding the Python Koans form set up to actual solving the tests.


### Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?

Yes, its rather tedious but it has its purpose.

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

Reading large blocks or text is not my favoured way to intake information but I also understand it important to knowing what I should know for this course.

### What is polymorphism?

Polymorphism is the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. An example of polymorphism child who simultaneously is a daughter, a sister, a student and more.

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

I do not think in words, I don’t have an inner monologue. While I can be self critical, it is not a voice in my head like this. I believe there are areas I need to improve and areas where I am succeeding. I don’t look to believe or not believe an “inner voice” as a concept, as my own emotions do not necessarily reflect reality. 

### What are you looking forward to learning about programming?
The creative element of putting together a programme that I can think of and develop myself instead of parameters dictated by someone else. 

### What is conscious listening?
Conscious listening is being very deliberate and present during communication between yourself and others whike considering other's feelings and needsa swell as your own.

### What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?
Python because of its commonality and broad use and Javascript, because of previous experience with it and being the most difficult amongst the main languages of web development.

### What is something kind that someone has done for you?
My parents contributed towards my mortgage.

### If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?
Programming is the process of designing a set of instructions that tell a computer how to execute a task.

### Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?
GitHub. I don't understand the benefits of it and it makes me question whether I am cut out for software development. It strikes me as basically an over complicated text document which makes me wonder if I'm misunderstanding the actual point and purpose. 

### What is a fixed mindset?
A fixed mindset is when someone believes their qualities such as intelligence are fixed traits that cannot and do not change. They do not recognise that they can develop their traits and believe that talent (regardless of effort) creates success.

### What is something kind you have done for someone else?
I cancelled plans with a friend when my wife messaged saying she was having a hard day at work and took care of the chores so we could just enjoy some time to relax together.

### Have you developed a habit of persevering?
Yes. I consider myself a “grinder”. I will work away at something, even if it is tedious, boring, or frustrating, until it is done.
